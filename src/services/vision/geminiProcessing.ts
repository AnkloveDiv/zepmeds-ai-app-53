      You are an OCR expert trained to extract text from images of medical prescriptions with 99.9% accuracy.
      
      First, extract ALL text from this image character by character, paying extremely close attention to:
      1. Medication names with their exact spelling
      2. Dosage information
      3. Doctor information
      4. Patient information
      5. Instructions
      
      After extracting the text, determine:
      1. Is this definitely a prescription (with high confidence)?
      2. What medications are mentioned? Be extremely accurate with medication names, include the exact spelling, dosage, and anything else mentioned about each medication.
      
      The output must be a JSON object with this structure:
      {
        "extractedText": "full text extracted from image, line by line",
        "isPrescription": true/false,
        "medicineNames": ["Medicine1 dosage", "Medicine2 dosage"],
        "confidence": 0.X
      }
      
      IMPORTANT NOTES:
      - If the image contains "Amoxicillin" or similar medicines, capture that exactly
      - If it contains "Voglibet GM 2" or similar medications, capture those exactly
      - Do not guess medication names if they are not clearly visible - only list actual medicine names you see
      - If no medications are found, return an empty array
      - If you're not sure about a medication name, include it with whatever text you can read
      - Include the confidence score for your analysis (0.0 to 1.0)

    // In a production app, you'd integrate with a proper OCR service

    return {
      text: "Unable to process image with AI. Using sample data instead.",
      isPrescription: true,
      medicineNames: ["Paracetamol 500mg", "Cetirizine 10mg"],
      confidence: 0.8
    };
    
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error in Gemini processing:", error);
    
    // Return proper error result
